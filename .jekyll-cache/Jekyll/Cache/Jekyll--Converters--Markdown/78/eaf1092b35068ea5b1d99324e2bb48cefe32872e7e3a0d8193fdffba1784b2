<p>I designed a user-centered mobile app providing daily information from sensors for aquaculture farmers, to help them raise production and reduce potential losses out of natural disasters.</p>
<p>I produced research of the application of tangible user interaction and gamification in agriculture referring to over 20 papers; highly praised by Prof. Henry Duh as a new research direction about HCI and food product innovation.</p>
<p>This work is one part of the project of <strong>HITLab Australia</strong>, University of Tasmania and <strong>sense-t</strong>. More information about the project can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sense-t.org.au/projects/aquaculture">here</a>.</p>
