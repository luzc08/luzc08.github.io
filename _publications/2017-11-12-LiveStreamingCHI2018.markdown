abstract: 'The $5 billion dollar live streaming industry has a tremendous impact on the social behaviours of internet users in China. However, despite early appearance of the technology in the North America, live streaming has yet to reach the level it has in China. Using observations from the rise and proliferation of live strseaming services in China, we identify some culture and social insights about the phenomenon as well as some lessons that we can apply to North America.'
